								<h3>Notes</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>Pork Belly – This is the best cut to use when cooking sinigang, in my opinion. The fat in the belly makes the meat moist which complements well to its tenderness. The other cuts of pork that I use are: pork shoulder, spare ribs, and pork neck bones.</li>
									<li>Young Tamarind – Use only young tamarind if you want your soup to be sour. However, a combination of both young and ripe tamarind can be good too, especially if you like your soup to have a hint of sweetness.</li>
									<li>Daikon Radish – This is an optional ingredient for sinigang. </li>
									<li>Taro (gabi) – Adding taro to the dish will make the soup thicker. This is a version of the dish known as sinigang na baboy with gabi.</li>
